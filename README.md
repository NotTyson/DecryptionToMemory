## Test Instructions
To begin testing, head into the Test File directory and copy the bdlog.txt into the bin/debug directory.

Once that has been completed, open up the Decryption to memory.exe and encrypt the file with a password.

Once the encryption is complete (Should be instant) inspect the documents content in the text editor of your choice.

Finally, head back into the Decryption to memory.exe, enter the password and decrypt the file. You will see the plain text of the document inside of the executable BUT the file is never modified.
